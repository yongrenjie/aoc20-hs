{-
- Overall strategy
- ----------------
-
- This puzzle was a real slog for me. The key assumption I made about the problem
- was that each edge can only line up with one other edge amongst all tiles (i.e.
- we would be able to identify matching edges unambiguously). The second assumption
- I made was that sea monsters (I call them serpents) did not overlap with each other.
-
- The method to piece together the jigsaw was largely as follows:
-
-  1. Convert (., #) to (0, 1) respectively. This is not needed for the jigsaw, but
-     it's handy for Step 9.
-
-  2. Identify which pieces have only two edges that can match with other tiles.
-     These must be the corner tiles. (This conveniently solves Part 1.)
-
-  3. Without loss of generality, choose one of them as the top-left corner tile.
-     Rotate it such that the edges that *can* match face inwards (i.e. to the east
-     and to the south).
-
-  4. Build the first column by iteratively searching for the tile to the bototm of
-     a given tile. When we cannot find any more tiles to go to the bottom, then we
-     know we have reached the end of the first column.
-
-  5. Build the rows of the puzzle by mapping Step 3 over each of the tiles in the
-     first column (except that the chains grow rightwards, not downwards).
-
-  6. Build the full matrix by stripping away the edges. In my case I stored the
-     edges in a separate record field from the inner bits. This matrix may not
-     necessarily be in the correct orientation to find serpents.
-
-  7. Build all possible serpent-sized submatrices from the matrix.
-
-  8. Build all possible orientations of the serpent. By checking the matrix against
-     every serpent orientation, we no longer need to flip / rotate the big matrix
-     itself.
-
-  9. Perform elementwise multiplication between the serpent and the submatrix. If 
-     the product is equal to the serpent, then there is a serpent in the submatrix
-     (this is rather like a 2D bitmask). Count the number of serpents.
-
- 10. Count the number of 1's in the matrix and subtract the number of serpents times
-     the number of 1's in a serpent for the answer to Part 2.
-
- Some parts of this would almost certainly have been easier using a more feature-rich
- library, such as Numpy. But plain old Vectors and Matrices were good enough this time.
