{-
- Overall strategy
- ----------------
-
- It appears that nearly all of the board will be empty, so it doesn't make sense
- to use a list or a vector to store what is mostly empty space. In a way, we need
- a sparse 4D matrix... which seems like it can be appropriately represented by an
- IntSet.
-
- In our IntSet, Ints corresponding to active cells will be members of the set.
- This means that each position in the game board must be mapped to a unique Int
- to be stored in the set.
-
- Since there are only six game turns, if the initial input has a size of m*m*1*1,
- the final game state can at most have a size of (m+12)*(m+12)*(1+12)*(1+12). In
- practice, it is a bit less confusing to just use (m+12)*(m+12)*(m+12)*(m+12). So,
- we can map (x, y, z, w) to a unique Int through
-
-    (x, y, z, w) --> (x+6)*((m+12)^3) + (y+6)*((m+12)^2) + (z+6)*(m+12) + (w+6)
-
- where we add 6 to everything to avoid negative numbers. (This also makes the
- reverse conversion much easier as we can just `divMod` without fear.) This is
- handled by `ind` and `deind`.
-
- This is a strategy adopted from /u/tel's post at
-
