Solutions for the [2020 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems in Haskell.

The algorithms are not really meant to be optimal, I'm just trying to get some practice in.

Run (e.g.) `cabal run d1` for the Day 1 answers.

------------------

## Things I've learnt along the way

- **Day 1** Basic file IO. A bit more about Cabal's system, including the `data-dir` entry.
- **Day 2** Using `Text` instead of `String`.
